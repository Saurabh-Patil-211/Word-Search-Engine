# Word-Search-Engine

[1] The Search Engine shows whether a particular Word is present in the Sentence or Not.

[2] The given code takes a Text and a Word as Input and passes them to a function called mySearch().

[3] The mySearch() function should return ”Word found” if the word is present in the text, or ”Word not found”, if it’s not.

[4] The User Interface is developed using Python’s GUI Tkinter.
